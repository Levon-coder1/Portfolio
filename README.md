# Asher Jay Portfolio

Modern, Apple-inspired single-page portfolio for Asher Jay — software engineer and gadget vendor. The refreshed theme uses a white, orange, light-orange, cream, and black palette with cinematic gradients and parallax micro-interactions inspired by webenart.com’s flow.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience. All assets are self-contained (HTML/CSS/JS only).

## Highlights
- Multi-section flow with hero, work showcase, services, device drops, and CTA.
- Parallax tags, tilt-on-hover cards, marquee stack strip, and reveal-on-scroll animations.
- Gradient-heavy, glassmorphism aesthetic tuned for desktop and mobile.

## Resolving merge conflicts without the command line
If GitHub shows a red conflict banner and you cannot use a terminal, use the browser-based editor:

1. Open your pull request and click **Resolve conflicts**.
2. For each file, choose the content you want to keep by deleting the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers and leaving the final text.
3. Click **Mark as resolved** for that file, then **Commit merge** when all files are resolved.
4. Refresh the PR—once conflicts are cleared the red banner disappears.

If you prefer a desktop app instead of the web UI, click **Open with GitHub Desktop** on the conflict prompt, resolve the files in the editor, commit, and push back to the branch.
