# Divinelove · Modern Portfolio

An Apple-inspired, motion-rich personal site for Divinelove: 22-year-old software engineer and gadget vendor (phones, laptops, gaming tech). Smooth depth, parallax, and tilt interactions keep it immersive.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Explore the sections (hero, offerings, showcase, stack, contact) with layered gradients and micro-interactions.

## Structure
- `index.html` — page markup and content for the portfolio.
- `styles.css` — immersive theme with gradients, glassmorphism, and responsive layout.
- `script.js` — tilt and parallax interactions plus smooth scrolling.

## Customization
- Update copy inside `index.html` to adjust services, links, or contact details.
- Tweak colors, radii, and shadows in `styles.css` under the `:root` variables.
- Adjust motion strength in `script.js` by editing `clamp` values and depth multipliers.
